.SH TAGS
Tags work like virtual desktops but are more flexible. A window can have
multiple tags, making it appear in multiple views. The view displays all
windows that have any of the currently selected tags.

When the last window in a tag is closed, truetm automatically switches to the
previously visited tag.
.SH BROADCAST MODE
When broadcast mode is enabled (toggle with Ctrl+B a), all keyboard input is
sent to every visible window simultaneously. This is useful for running the
same commands across multiple terminals.
.SH SCROLLBACK
Each window stores up to 10,000 lines of scrollback history, accessible via
copy mode or mouse scroll.
