.SH SYNOPSIS
.B truetm
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B truetm
is a terminal multiplexer with truecolor support. It uses a
dwm-style tagging system where windows can have multiple tags and views can
display windows with any of the selected tags.

as the prefix key.

.SH LAYOUT
Master window on the left, remaining windows stacked vertically on the right.
.SH TAGS
Tags work like virtual desktops but are more flexible. A window can have
multiple tags, making it appear in multiple views. The view displays all
windows that have any of the currently selected tags.

When the last window in a tag is closed, truetm automatically switches to the
previously visited tag.
.SH BROADCAST MODE
When broadcast mode is enabled (toggle with Ctrl+B a), all keyboard input is
sent to every visible window simultaneously. This is useful for running the
same commands across multiple terminals.
.SH CONFIGURATION
truetm follows the dwm philosophy of compile-time configuration. Edit
src/config.rs and recompile to customize keybindings and settings.
