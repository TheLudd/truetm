.SH TAGS
Tags work like virtual desktops but are more flexible. A window can have
multiple tags, making it appear in multiple views. The view displays all
windows that have any of the currently selected tags.

When the last window in a tag is closed, simplex automatically switches to the
previously visited tag.
.SH BROADCAST MODE
When broadcast mode is enabled (toggle with Ctrl+B a), all keyboard input is
sent to every visible window simultaneously. This is useful for running the
same commands across multiple terminals.
.SH CONFIGURATION
simplex follows the dwm philosophy of compile-time configuration. Settings are
modified by editing the source code and recompiling.
